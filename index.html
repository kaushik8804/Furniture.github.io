                    <h3>Bridge Water sofa</h3>
                    <p>A simple and classic sofa, the Bridgewater is defined as having a low profile and low arms that
                        are set back from the frontmost part of the sofa. A traditional Bridgewater sofa features a
                        skirt and a rolled back. The looseness of Bridgewater backs and cushions makes them a great pick
                        for those who want adjustable firmness.</p>

                    <p>The récaimer is another historic sofa style, originating from the French hostess, Julie Adélaïde
                        Bernard Récamier, who was painted by Jacques-Louis David, sitting on a backless couch (now, the
                        récamier). The récamier can be best described as a backless daybed with two scrolled ends.

                    <p>Known as the “family sofa,” sectionals are a great option for people who prefer to customize
                        their sofa configuration and style options. Sectionals are defined as having sections (separate
                        pieces) that can be attached to one another to achieve the desired look. They are made up of
                        more than two pieces. With a sectional, you have many options, including attaching a settee to a
                        chaise, a sofa to a corner seat.</p>

                <p>when you're talking about the original, here's what that means: Simply put, a Chesterfield sofa is a
                    large couch with rolled arms that are the same height as the back. A quintessential Chesterfield is
                    upholstered in a dark leather, with deep button tufting all over and nailhead trim</p>

                <h2>Divans</h2>
                <p> The term divan originated in Persia. Traditionally, a divan refers to a long seat made from a
                    mattress that is placed against a wall with cushions to lean on. The modern-day divan has a
                    mattress-like seat that is tufted and sits on a low-profile frame. Divans are still typically placed
                    against a wall and decorated with pillows, and are often used as a bed for guests. According to
                    Houzz, “think of the divan as the daybed’s older, more lounge-worthy sibling.”</p>

                <p>Today, the chaise longue isn't seen as a typical furniture requirement but a luxury or novelty for
                    the modern home. They are often used to complement a home's décor outside of the bedroom, and used
                    as a stylish boudoir chair for bedroom seating and somewhere to sit to put shoes and socks on while
                    getting ready.

                <h2>loveseats</h2>
                <p>While a love seat and a settee are often used synonymously, there are actually some differences
                    between the two. While a settee traditionally fits two or more people, a love seat is designed to
                    specifically fit two. Unlike settees, loveseats are always sold as an individual piece of furniture,
                    and cannot be attached to sectionals (sectionals use settees).

                <h2>knole</h2>
                <p>According to Apartment Therapy, the Knole sofa has a deep history that dates back to the 17th
                    century. Originally created as an upholstered settee for the historic English house, Knole, it was
                    one of the first-ever designs of its kind. The Knole set the stage for many sofas and couches to
                    come. In modern day, the Knole sofa is a settee defined by its adjustable arms and deep seat.
                    Typically, it has exposed wood detailing and finials, and (most distinctively) features side arms
                    tied to the back of the sofa with braids or tassels.</p>
